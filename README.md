# Finance demo

Originally created as a challenge for a job interview. It has since been slightly refactored and improved.
I've split up some of the main components into their own respective files and removed some of the bootstrap dependencies.
A build is now launched on [Vercel](https://finance-demo.vercel.app/) to show the progress.
